00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,209
P

1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,250
N.

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:08,489
I never say hello

3
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:17,979
love

4
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:18,989
this one.

5
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:24,139
M

6
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:29,559
is

7
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:33,180
disaster and joy

8
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:35,709
h.

9
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:40,970
during those first months

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,580
they had sex

11
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:46,470
they got to know each other in many ways,

12
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,340
and realized that she would behave differently towards others

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,669
but especially towards a man,

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,500
a young man.

15 00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:55,900
He seems to be the most humble

16 00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,740
so as not to burden

17 00:00:59,069 --> 00:00:59,909
his bride.

18
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,069
so that he sees her that way

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,949
if you're too busy in that first moment together,

20
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:08,879
that's not good

21
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,349
because you don't know your partner.

22
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,940
And hiding something

23
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:15,680
and then it comes later

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,830
is also bad.

25
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:17,620
if it's a boy

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,559
he likes something

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,839
-- he tells his bride that now there are
-- games.

28 00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,830 I don't know if 29 00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,379 they get time to play now.

30
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:32,760
-- but playing is also
-- good for couples

31
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,099
married

32
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,989
so while you're at it, how about playing

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,519
how about

34
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:44,599
so that's the answer.

35
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:59,250
We welcome our followers on Murinzi TV and we are now in a family program

36
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:02,970
Today we are with our parents who have come for advice

37
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:06,519
and we are going to discuss issues related to

38
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,288
and social life and good relationships at home

39
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:11,699
which are things that can build a family,

40
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,220
and family in need at this time

41
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,270
we hope you will benefit a lot.

42
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:20,139
We are with the father Pastor Kagoyera Simeon,

43
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:24,619
who is with our mother, the lady, let's hurry up.

44
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,130

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,550
the audience

46
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,179
This conversation.

47
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,529
No

48
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:39,220
on TV

49
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,970
I am old.

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,300
in the name of Jesus Christ

51
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,039
may God's peace be with you,

52
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
My name is Simeon Kagwera.

53
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,080
As Lotel said.

54
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,419
I am a pastor.

55
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,559
At the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Abad City.

56
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,389
And I was retired.

57
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,130
Yes

58
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,320
and my mother continues

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,440
I greet you in the name of Jesus,

60
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,630
here we are in the family

61
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,580
of Pastor Kagera Simeon.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,789
We thank God very much

63
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,610

64
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,410
