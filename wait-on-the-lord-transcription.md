This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. I'm Dr. Michael T. Scott Sr., Senior Pastor of the Galilee Baptist Church, located at 1216 North West Niche Avenue in the city of Kalamazoo, Michigan. We want to welcome you to another edition of the Rainbow Word Telecast. It's an honor and a privilege to be able to bring the Gospel into your homes and into your communities. We know that it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ that changes lives. We ask that you would prepare yourself for a message already in progress, and we know that God is going to speak to you today through the Word of the Lord. Let's go to a message already in progress.
