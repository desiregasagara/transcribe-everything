# 🧠 AI Language Translation – Reconnecting with My Roots

This repository contains the code, tools, and notes from my personal journey to translate and understand an old audio interview of my grandparents speaking Kinyarwanda — my mother tongue that I’ve yet to fully master.

What started as a moment of frustration turned into an exploration of how AI can bridge language barriers, especially for minority languages.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project explores and compares multiple AI transcription and translation tools to understand their support for lesser-known languages like Kinyarwanda:

- 🎙️ OpenAI Whisper (speech-to-text)
- 🗣️ Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- 🧠 AWS Transcribe
- 💬 GPT-4 translation

Along the way, I encountered limitations, workarounds, and even a surprise reply on a GitHub issue that kept the journey going.
